# Dataharvest2025

Please download the lesson for [Visualizing Data](https://github.com/gebelo/Dataharvest2025/blob/main/analyze_with_your_eyes.html) or [Mapping](https://github.com/gebelo/Dataharvest2025/blob/main/mapping_in_code.html) and open it in your web browser.

I've created a virtual R environment for working with this code in a Github Codespace. To get started, follow steps 1-9 on this [page](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). (You need to be logged into Github).

Once you have a copy of the repository, you can open the virtual environment by clicing on Code, Codespaces and launching the codespace in your browser.
